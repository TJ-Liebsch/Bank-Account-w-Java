# Bank-Account-w-Java
In this repository you see me create a bank account program with both Java GUI and Java. Where I utilzed Apache NetBeans IDE 20 to create a simple bank account with Java GUI and Java. This was an assignment for my SE 350 course at St. Cloud State University. Part of the assignement was to create this based of this bank account design which you can see in the repository under the name "Bank Account Design".

If you would like to run this then first download netBeans and then open the project in there. Once you have opened the project, right click on the BankAccountGUI.java and it should allow you to run the file. That should allow you to run my program, enjoy!
